# Build a diabetes prediction app using Flask and machine learning
In this project, we will build a diabetes prediction app using Flask and machine learning. We will use four different algorithms (logistic regression, KNN, SVM, and random forest) to compare which one gives the best accuracy. Once we have found the best algorithm, we will deploy it to a web application that was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app will help users predict if they would have diabetes on real-time data.
